Seeing this historic staging of Boys in the Band was the only reason I withstood the beastly humidity and heat of a New York summer. The All-star out gay cast could only fit a summer run around their day jobs. Entirely worth it though. Third row seats allowed maximum immersion. 

I've waited for this all my life really.

The show was enthralling and hugely entertaining. One night in the lives of 9 gay men in 1968; actually the stories of our lives over the last 50 years - presented by 9 brilliantly talented gay men, including Matt Bomer, Zachary Quinto, Jim Parsons, and Andrew Rannells. 

Very different people, bringing out all sides of themselves. To be themselves today in 2018. Finally.
