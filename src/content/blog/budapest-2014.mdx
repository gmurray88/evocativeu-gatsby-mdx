Budapest was my second stop visiting the lands of my forebears. My great-grandfather emigrated from Hungary in the 1920s, and I enjoyed finding my Hungarian roots. Unfortunately, as was the case in Austria, I have no known relatives in Hungary, because that branch of the family is Jewish and the Nazis killed them all.

Budapest is a fantastic city with loads of culture and character, but it came off as rather dingy, especially after having spent the previous few days in Vienna. Like East Berlin and West Berlin, the economic differences between ex-Communist European countries and their Western counterparts are obvious, even 25 years after the fall of the Iron Curtain.
