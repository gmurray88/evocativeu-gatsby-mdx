Not so many years ago, any scriptwriter or showrunner coming up with something like actual current events would have been laughed out of town.

The President of the United States, in the throes of a highly-contagious and often-fatal disease, dramatically removing his mask and walking into the White House, potentially infecting and killing everyone in proximity.

National leaders becoming infected almost faster than we can count.

The presidential election mere days away.

"Preposterous. Would never happen."
