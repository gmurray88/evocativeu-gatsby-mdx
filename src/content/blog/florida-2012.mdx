Enjoyed a leisurely week in the Florida Keys, with a couple days in Miami.

I hadn't done much boating on the open seas for decades, due to bad memories of violent seasickness. I really wanted to try snorkeling, and to tour the Keys by boat, so I hired a private boat with instructions to return to shore at the slightest sign of seasickness. Luckily the water was smooth.

I discovered how much I loved snorkeling in warm water coral reefs, and that I am not a good underwater photographer.
