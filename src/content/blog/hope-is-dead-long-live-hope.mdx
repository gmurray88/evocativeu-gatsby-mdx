I just drove past where my friend Hope died in 2002. We met in rehab in 1998 when I was 36 and she was 38. When she died she was 53.

Her car veered off the freeway into a tree. We don't know if it was suicide or accident. Nor if she was extra-opiated. Her conservative Catholic parents did not acknowledge the truth. We do know, as only fellow deep sufferers can, how sad and unhappy she was. Mercifully that ended. Hope Dominguez was a lovely, considerate and deeply thoughtful person. She lives on in those of us who knew and cared about her.
