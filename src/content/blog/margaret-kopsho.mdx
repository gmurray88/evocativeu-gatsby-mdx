Looked up my childhood friend, Margaret Kopsho, on Facebook to initiate a reunion. While catching up, we were delighted to find we both had achieved sobriety after some rough years (decades, really).
I got my first dog, Tuffy, from the Kopshos. I was afraid my parents would say no to getting a puppy, so I hid him in a moving box on my bedroom closet shelf. Needless to say that didn't last long before he was discovered. Luckily they agreed to let me keep him.
