Not a drag queen. Not trans. Just Sylvester! 

Attended opening night in San Francisco of Mighty Real: The Fabulous Sylvester Musical. From running around South Central L.A. in the 60's in high heels and couture, to superstardom in the 80's. Girl had a dream!

Special treat seeing this with my close friend Jimmy Reynolds, who was Sylvester's manager back in the day. That's Jimmy with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeanie_Tracy">Jeanie Tracy</a>
