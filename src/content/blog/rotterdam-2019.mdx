Rotterdam, Holland, has some of the best modern architecture in Europe. Sadly the city was heavily bombed in World War II. The resulting devastation allowed for the current proliferation of modern masterpieces.

I stayed at the Mainport Design Hotel in Rotterdam, Holland. My corner room came with a panoramic view, a jacuzzi, and sauna.

All for half the price of a comparable room in Amsterdam. And perfectly situated for day trips to The Hague and Amsterdam.
