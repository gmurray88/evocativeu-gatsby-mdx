When Squeeze came on the scene in the late 1970's, lead songwriters Chris Difford and Glenn Tillbrook were mentioned as worthy successors to Lennon and McCartney. They never achieved Beatles-level fame, but their songs have stood the test of time. I thoroughly enjoyed their tight set at Grass Valley's Center for the Arts.
