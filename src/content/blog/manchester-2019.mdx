In Manchester to visit with family and attend a United match with my cousin Dean, enjoying the experience in a VIP suite pre- and post-match.

We had fantastic seats next to the Directorsâ€™ Box, near the great Sir Alex Ferguson. The result against Cardiff City was poor, as was much of the season. Always hopeful for a better season next year.
