I was very excited visiting the French Riviera for the first time. Watching my first sunset I appreciated why artists are so enraptured by the light here.

My hotel in Nice, Boscolo Exedra, was light and airy, perfect for the French Riviera / Côte d'Azur.

Nice is colorful, sensual and vibrant - full of creative architecture, public art and gorgeous fragrant flora.

My favorite object was the Tête Carrée (Square Head), an 85-foot-tall sculpture housing part of the central library. Note: the Tête Carrée pics are not mine. I couldn't do it justice.

Nice certainly has a penchant for male nudes. They even light up at night!

Nice, France has a promontory in the middle of the city, site of a medieval castle (of course). My first day in Nice I looked up from the beach and saw a waterfall tumbling from the top of the hill - quite a sight. I had to investigate. The waterworks are part of a 19th century rerouting of a canal.

From fabulous shops and architecture to stunning beaches, and of course the storied French Riviera glam lifestyle, Nice has it all!
