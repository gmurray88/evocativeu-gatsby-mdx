Anyone flying west for long distances is familiar with the phenomenon of "time standing still" during the flight, since the airspeed keeps up with the changing time zones. I had the fascinating experience of taking a mid-winter flight from London to Los Angeles where it was continuous daytime during the one of the shortest days of the year in the far north. The flight took off late morning, so it was midday for most of the flight. The weather was mostly cloudless. I spent hours looking out the window at polar landscapes that were seeing just a few hours of daylight.

Rare sights of rare beauty.
