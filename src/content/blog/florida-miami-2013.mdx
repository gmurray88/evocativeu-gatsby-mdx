On to Miami, and thankfully better weather than the Keys. I visited the classic Eden Roc and Fontainebleau hotels. They are past their 1950s heyday, but it didn't take much imagination to picture those days of retro style and glamour in Miami Beach. Phillipe Starck's Delano South Beach is a newer iconic addition to the design pantheon of Miami Beach hotels.

My room at the lesser-known Dream South Beach matched the classic hotels for style and originality. I noticed a commotion one day in the lobby, and was told that Five Seconds of Summer, the opening band for One Direction, was staying at the hotel. Their fans were neither as numerous nor avid as the Directioners, though they were still waiting loyally outside the hotel for a glimpse of the band.

From Cape Florida on Key Biscayne, I saw a group of what looked like houses sitting about a mile offshore. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiltsville">Stiltsville</a>, a community of about 30 houses, arose in the 1920s - 1940s in the shallow waters of Biscayne Bay, in typically inconoclastic Floridian style. As would be expected of any outsider community, all types of behavior took place there, starting with Prohibition Era speakeasies and continuing with a variety of social clubs. 

Time and hurricanes reduced the community over the decades to the present-day seven structures, which have been preserved as historical landmarks.
