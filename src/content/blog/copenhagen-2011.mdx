Play word association with Danish and a likely answer is Design. I stayed at the Royal Scandinavian Hotel in Copenhagen, one of the first hotels with a single designer responsible for archtitecture and interior design, internationally-renowned Arne Jacobsen. The interiors of the hotel are still filled with his iconice Swan Chairs and Egg Chairs. The rooms have been updated over the decades, while remaining true to Jacobsen's original vision. One of the rooms has been preserved with original furnishings. If you ask nicely at the front desk, you can get a private viewing.
