My visit to the beautiful and stately city of The Hague was highlighted by a visit to the Mauritshuis museum.

It’s a small museum that is home to several renowned  masterpieces, including Fabritius’ The Goldfinch, Vermeer’s Girl With A Pearl Earring, and Rembrandt’s Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp.

I’ve seen reproductions of The Goldfinch, but I was overcome with emotions upon viewing the original. The poor little chained bird has a look of terrible sadness, though there remains an aura of pride and defiance about the bird. Somewhat akin to the human condition.

Donna Tartt wrote an eponymous Pulitzer Prize-winning novel centered mostly around the painting, soon to be released as a major motion picture.

M.C. Escher's art is instantly recognizable to his many fans - his singular style mainly consisting of geometric patterns and optical illusions.

The Escher Museum in The Hague contains the most complete collection of his mind-blowing works.
