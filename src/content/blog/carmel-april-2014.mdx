Phoebe, our Maltese who passed away last November, loved Carmel - romping on the beach, hobnobbing in the art-centric village. Doris Day in the 1980's inspired Carmel's rebirth as one of the first dog-friendly cities in the world. It was our favorite place to take Phoebe, and Gigi's first trip helped us build new happy memories, though it will take a while before our visits here won't be tinged with sadness.
