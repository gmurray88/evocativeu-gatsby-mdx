subtitle: Computers that can help people be better people.
---

Since computers have been invented, a primary goal has been Artificial Intelligence – to design computers that “think” like people. A related utopian ( or dystopian? ) goal has been Singularity – where computers surpass humans’ abilities. In theory, computers would teach themselves to evolve much faster than humans to the point of becoming “super” beings with abilities we as humans can only dream of.
 
Perhaps a more worthy goal for computers than making them think like people – or surpass people, would be to make computers that can help people be better people. 

By better – not necessarily smarter, bigger, stronger and more accomplished. Actually happier, healthier, more fulfilled, more ethical and harmonious (with others and our surroundings).

How can we do this?
