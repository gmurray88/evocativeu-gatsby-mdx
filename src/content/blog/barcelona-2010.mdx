Most visit Barcelona for the spectacular seaside parties. Perhaps too many, according to locals. More interesting to me was the whimsical architecture of Gaudi located throughout the city. Most famous example being La Sagrada Familia church, under construction since 1882, with yet another completion date scheduled for 2026.
