Though I get to Europe most every year, I'm calling this trip my Grand Tour of Europe, in homage to the centuries-old tradition of touring Europe to gain an artistic education. My current endeavours in Virtual Reality include visiting some of Europe's greatest artistic and design-oriented institutions with an eye towards developing VR environments, and meeting with representatives of museums and showrooms. Since I did not take one as a young adult, I am deeming this my Grand Tour, albeit with more grown-up aspirations.

First stop on the Continent - Lyon, France. My hotel, the Cour des Loges, is located in Renaissance-era Vieux Lyon (Old Lyon) - historically apropos of a Grand Tour. My suite is described as a photographer’s studio, though it is more like a micromuseum of photography, including a lovely old camera. The hotel spa is open until midnight, perfect for this jet-lagged Californian.

Lyon is scenically situated at the confluence of the Rhône and the Saône, with Vieux Lyon climbing the hill topped by the Basilica of Notre Dame watching over the city. Full of stunning architecture and other cultural wonders, Lyon is the third major French city I have visited, after several stays in Paris and a trip to Nice.

J'adore la France.

Roche Bobois is among the world's leading design houses of modern furniture. The Lyon, France showroom is their largest by far. I was like a kid in a candy store. My favorite was the aptly-named Macaron chaise longue.
