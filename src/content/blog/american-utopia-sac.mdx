Experienced David Byrne’s American Utopia show last night in Sacramento.
Best show he’s led since Talking Heads’ Stop Making Sense tour in the ‘80s and one of the Top 5 shows I’ve ever seen. All 12 musicians – including 6 percussionists – wore wireless instruments, freeing up the stage for choreography and lighting. No amps, no drum risers. A truly original combination of concert, performance art and dance. Leave it to David Byrne to lead the way again. We danced ecstatically to classics like “Burning Down the House” and “Once in a Lifetime” plus newer favorites. Words will ultimately fail to describe the astounding effects of this show.
