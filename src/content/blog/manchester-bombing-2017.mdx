Much of my family lives in Manchester. Thankfully they are okay, but so many lives have been lost, many of them children. This violence has to stop. Hate and killing only begets more hate and killing.

Manchester has suffered so much - IRA bombings in my youth, World War II destruction when my mother was a child.

Shock and sadness beyond words, like moving through a bad dream
