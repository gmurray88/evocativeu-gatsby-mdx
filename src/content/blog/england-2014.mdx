While in England, I attended two Manchester United matches, both in the Europa VIP Suite. The match against Queens Park Rangers, which I saw with my cousin Alison, was a comfortable 4-0 romp. The match against West Ham, which I saw with my cousin Karen, was a nailbiter. The lads came away with a 2-1 win. Gutsy effort after Rooney's shocking dismissal.

In London, another visit to my favorite museum in England - The V&A, and my first time at the Courtauld Gallery. As always, I loved the collection of art glass at the V&A. I visited the Courtauld mainly to see the Jasper Johns: Regrets exhibition, which was excellent. I was also delighted to see Kandinsky's "Red Circle", Seurat's "Bridge of Courbevoie" and Van Gogh's "Self-Portrait with Bandaged Ear".

On my last night in Europe, I enjoyed a great West-End revival of Evita. Madalena Alberto was fabulous, more than up to a tough role. Ask Madonna how tough.
