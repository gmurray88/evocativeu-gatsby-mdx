subtitle: Third brood in six months!

I thought it was adorable when a new family of ducks appeared one day in my pool. Three broods and six months later, not so much. Either a very busy mother, or they were telling each other about my lovely poolside nest.

After this brood I removed the nest and thinned the foliage. Hopefully that will stop the duck assembly line. Once a year I wouldn't have minded, but this was excessive.
