Prague is often included in short lists of the most beautiful cities in Europe. Situated on the Vltava River, with Prague Castle overlooking the old city and many beautiful old churches and civic buildings, it is a wonderful city to explore and photograph.

One of the most provocative public artworks I have seen - The Pissing Fountain in Prague. If you text a message, they will spell it out. 
The statues are standing in a pool shaped like the Czech Republic. The artist, David Cerny, is known for making political statements through his art.
In the background is the Franz Kafka Museum. I think he would approve, albeit mournfully
