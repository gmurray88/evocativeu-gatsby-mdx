I took my first holiday trip to visit family in England since I was a child. 
After spending Christmas in Manchester with my cousins, I flew to Paris and spent New Year's Eve on a bridge over the Seine near the Eiffel Tower.

Even in the brittle light of winter, Paris is a gorgeous city. The Galleries Lafayette and gigantic Swarovski Christmas Tree were especially stunning.

Having visited Paris twice previously doing the typical touristy activites, I wanted to experience Paris more like a local. Shopping daily at the world-famous Parisian markets seemed like a good start. I took an apartment near Rue Montorgueil that came with a little pull cart for shopping. Very thoughtful and practical. The experience was mostly a success, though I didn't get to the markets early enough in the morning to experience the freshest offerings, and I am no Julia Child in the kitchen.
