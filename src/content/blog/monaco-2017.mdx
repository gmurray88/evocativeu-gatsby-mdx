Close to Nice is the Principality of Monaco, making for an ideal day trip.

Monte Carlo Casino was first on my list. It was much smaller than I expected, only about ten tables and a few dozen slots on the main floor. Another case of the legend being larger than reality. Not much of a gambler; I played one slot machine for a few minutes and walked away with $40, though it cost $20 to get in. It was still an enjoyable experience taking in the atmosphere of the storied casino.

Shopping was appropriately luxe for the rich tax haven. Mostly out of my price range, but the window shopping was fun.

Being the hopeless romantic I am, the trip was highlighted by a visit to the Prince's Palace, home to Princess Grace (n√©e Grace Kelly) before her tragic death in an auto accident in 1982.
