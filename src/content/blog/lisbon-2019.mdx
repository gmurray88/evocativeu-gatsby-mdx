In my quest to visit at least one new country during each European trip, Portugal was next on my list. I stayed at the Altis Belém Hotel in Lisbon, in a room with a gorgeous view of the Tagus River estuary, made even more enjoyable by a jacuzzi on my terrace.

Lisbon has similar geography to San Francisco - built on hills and surrounded by water. The Ponte 25 de Abril Bridge even resembles the Golden Gate Bridge. Also visible in the view from my terrace are Belem Lighthouse and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ_the_King_(Almada)">Sancturary of Christ the King</a> (lit in far background), which was itself inspired by Rio De Janeiro's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ_the_Redeemer_(statue)">Christ the Redeemer</a> statue.

The Monument of the Discoveries looks over the Tagus, commemmorating the Portuguese Golden Age of Exploration.

Ferdinand Magellan was the first European to sail around the earth. Italian-born Amerigo Vespucci (for whom America was named) sailed under the Portuguese flag to the New World. And Vasco de Gama was the first European to sail to India, around Africa's Cape of Good Hope. Quite the accomplishments for such a small country.

Portugal is known for its elaborate pavements and ceramic tiles - Azulejos.

Lisbon’s Parque Das Naçoes was developed for the 1998 World’s Fair. Also built were new subway stations and the Vasco de Gama Bridge, second longest in Europe at 7.6 miles. The area’s sleek modernism contrasts with the older central city.
