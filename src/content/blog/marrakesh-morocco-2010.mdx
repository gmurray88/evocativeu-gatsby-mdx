Marrakesh is the only overseas city I have visited where I regret not hiring a guide. For me the main attraction was the central square, Jemaa el-Fnaa, and the internationaly-renowned souk marketplace. It was wonderful to walk around, but I did not have a clue how to separate quality locally-made goods from cheap imported knockoffs. The haranguing bargaining was also a bit much.
Finding safe food was also a challenge. The street food was fascinating to observe and smell, but I could not tell what was safe. I ended up eating and drinking everything at my hotel. 
At one of the nightly dinners for guests, I shared a table with two Englishwomen who raved about the street food, while I admitted I was terrified to try any of it.
I felt somewhat vindicated, though quite sorry for the women, when the front desk woke me at 4:00 am one morning to pass on a request from the women for medicine to quell food poisoning (I couldn't help them). They were on the way to the airport and did not have time to find a local pharmacist.
