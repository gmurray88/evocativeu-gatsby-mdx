She’s every woman! Chaka Khan gave a master class in singing and performing Saturday night at Cache Creek. It was especially poignant just two days after Aretha’s passing. They were friends, Chaka said. 

After pulling out some older gems from the deep catalog during her Rufus days (probably for us older folks in the casino crowd), Chaka sent us into a frenzy finishing with “I Feel For You,” “I’m  Every Woman” and “Ain’t Nobody.” Glorious!
