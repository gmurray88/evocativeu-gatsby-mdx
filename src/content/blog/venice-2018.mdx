For my stay in Venice, I chose a hotel in Murano, so as to be close to my favorite glass galleries - Venini, Seguso, Moretti, et al.

My suite was nice enough, though not as high style as others I’ve stayed in. The room was full of high-end Venetian glass, though the placement was a bit odd. For example, nearly $3000 worth of gorgeously hued Venini fazoletto ( crinkled handkerchief ) vases were tucked away in a dim corner.
On the plus side, the shower was big enough to sublet, and had a large porthole window looking over the canal. And the televisions inset into the bathroom mirrors were a lot of fun.

All the windows had great canal views, even the funky half windows behind bars, since I could see through them laying down in bed or sitting on the couch. The reason for these was the hotel was originally a glass factory, and the exteriors could not be altered in history-conscious Venice.

My favorite Venetian art glass on this trip was at Seguso. The lovely Giulia Seguso, latest descendant of the family making glass in Venice since 1397(!), graciously displayed some pieces to their best effect outside the studio. Stunning!  

Other galleries did not disappoint. Art glass is my favorite media of fine art. It still surprises me that photography's elevation into the pantheon of fine art has not been debated nearly as strongly as art glass' "promotion" from decorative arts. Personally I think it is more a power struggle than anything else.

Peggy Guggenheim's palazzo houses one of the world's finest collection of modern art. Friend, wife, mentor. Peggy knew them all. After meeting Piet Mondrian at his studio, she commented, “He kissed me and I was surprised to discover how young he was at 72!”

More exquisite art from before the modern era awaited at the Gallerie dell'Accademia.
A highlight was an exhibit of Bosch paintings showcasing the latest methods of restoration.

Venice itself is a work of art.
