subtitle: No justice for all in America. Justice per micro-republic

I can’t help but notice that the Trayvon Martin verdict is the second recent major historical event (the other being the gay marriage Supreme Court decisions) where state laws play a significant role.

Florida’s gun laws and culture allowed a technically legal verdict which almost certainly wouldn’t have been delivered in California, Illinois, New York and many other states. Though equal rights for gay marriage now exist in 13 states, such is not the case in the 37 others.

Only in America can such profound legal issues be left up to individual states. It’s almost as if there is no justice for all in America, but justice per micro-republic
