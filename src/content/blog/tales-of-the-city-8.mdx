Just finished Tales of the City - Part 8 (Mary Ann in Autumn). Classic Armistead. Like a visit with old friends, with 2010 twists. The subplot with now 57-year-old Mary Ann joining Facebook is priceless! And integral. Didn't even have to buy the book. Turns out that mutiple holds which are invariably placed on new books don't apply to Central Express downtown. Yet another reason to frequent this great library!

Have tix to SF world premier of TOTC musical in May with music by Scissor Sisters Jake Shears and John Garden. High hopes, but the same could be said for Lestat with music/lyrics by Elton John and Bernie Taupin and that was a turgid mess...
