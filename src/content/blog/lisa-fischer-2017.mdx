Just saw the amazing Lisa Fischer in Berkeley. Best show I’ve seen in a long time. By someone I had barely heard of, though we’ve all heard her singing backup for The Rolling Stones, Sting, Luther Vandross, Nine Inch Nails and many more megastars. Launched to newfound fame, ironically, by the recent documentary “20 Feet From Stardom”, about noted backup singers. 

Mesmerizingly sensual, spiritual and political – often in the same song – Ms. Fischer has taken from the masters and made a style all her own. If you get a chance, run don’t walk to see her perform.

Many thanks to Jimmy Reynolds for providing the experience.
