I crossed the Alps on the historic Bernina Express, a 4-hour train ride in all-glass coaches. Postcard views the whole time.  
Immediately hit it off with two couples from Australia and Wisconsin. Though we were all middle-aged, we gasped and exclaimed like a bunch of excited kids. 

Looking at these pictures is it any wonder.

My base in Switzerland was Lucerne, enviously situated along Lake Lucerne and the Reuss River at the foot of the Alps.

Stayed at the Hotel Chateau Gutsch, a classic 19th-century hotel perched directly above the Old Town.

My main excursion into the Alps was via Lauterbrunnen ( "loud water" ) Valley, the Yosemite of the Alps. I had never seen so many waterfalls in once place. Spectacular, breathtaking - you get the picture.

I took a cable car to the top of Schilthorn, and the revolving restaurant Piz Gloria, which was the scene of location-filming for the James Bond movie "On Her Majesty's Secret Service". All-in-all a fantastic day trip to the Swiss Alps.
