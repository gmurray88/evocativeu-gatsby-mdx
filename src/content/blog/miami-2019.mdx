Heading back home after a fabulous vacation, I had an unexpected (paid for) overnight layover in Miami, due to a delayed departure. I wasn't in a big hurry, and there are worse places to be.

Time for a side trip to Miami Beach. Looking at the Versace Mansion, I couldn’t help but feel that I was stalking à la Andrew Cunanan / Darren Criss. I even spotted a person vaguely reminiscent of Andrew Cunanan standing near the same spot Darren Criss' character awaited his opportunity.
